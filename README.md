This website was created by vanconywhale for the 2019 FBLA Website Design project.

Note: The website may not work properly in older browsers, such as internet explorer.

General Notes:
- pure HTML, CSS, and JS were used to make the website
- website is static and has no server-side (database) components
- jQuery was used for the calendar widget
- paint.net was used to edit and format images, while Google Drawings was used to design the logo
- Caret (a google extension) was used to type a edit the code
*more credits regarding images can be found on the website!
*UPDATE* added Round Trip 5/25/2020
- calendar restriction for Round Trip based off of source from jQuery datepicker documentation:
  https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-range

Navigation:
- index.html is the homepage, while the other .html files are all subpages
- two external stylesheets were used: style.css for header/footer, and footer-style.css for terms/policy/credits page layout
- template.html was used to create the other .html files (not used in the website)
- the jquery files were used for the calendar widget on the "Book a Flight" page
- all images used in the website was in the "images" folder, where they were all referenced from (including jquery icons)
- icons folder has images that were used to create some of the images- They are not used in the website
- the experiments folder contains test code that was used to test different methods and programs

Code Structure Info (more detailed):
- CSS design was created from scratch (quite difficult actually...), with header/footer stylers brought to each website via style.css
- 3 responsive settings were made: desktop, tablet (max 1150px), and phone (max 670px)
- CSS media queries and respective selector modifications were used to create responsive changes
- the only JS used was (1) for the flight scheduling program and (2) making animations wait for the page to load before starting
- the program used for animation wait can be found here: https://css-tricks.com/making-animations-wait/
- HTML design contained a lot of container divs and classes, which allowed CSS formatting

Thanks for checking out this website!
In the future, I may want to implement CSS frameworks and JS libraries so the website-making process is easier and more organized.
